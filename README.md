Offered with very little explanation. I've been asked to provide the code for my neopixel wall clock
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8UPwE-N8cI), so here it is.

This project requires a 144-pixel neopixel strip (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1507) 
and a DS1307 real-time clock (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3296).

What you can't see in the video is that the pixel strip is not attached to the exterior perimeter of
the wood circle. I used a router to put a recessed groove in the back of the board. This serves two
purposes. First, it allowed me to get the circumference of the recession exactly right to have no
gap between LEDs at the ends of the strip. Second, it hides the LEDs from view. This way, you're not
blinded by the thing if you're looking at it from an angle and means the "hands" of the clock are
the diffuse reflection of light from the wall.

If there's enough interest, maybe I'll post more video of the back of the clock so you can see how
I built the thing.
